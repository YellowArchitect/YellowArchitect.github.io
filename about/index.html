	<h1>Oh, you want to know more about me?</h1> <! ;) >
	<p>I'm Benjamin Schmidt, a Computer Science graduate from Virginia Tech. I mostly made this site so that I wouldn't forget how to do basic web design stuff, but I've continued to add to it over the years.</p>
	<p>Active projects I'm working on is a fighting game made in Unity named Bible Versus and I've started dabbling in Minecraft modding, because why not. Outside of computers I've done some gardening, know a little music theory, enjoy camping, and love bees and bee related things.</p>
	<p>I'm interested in trying to make a simple game engine at some point, but I want to get a better understanding of game design before embarking on that adventure.</p>
