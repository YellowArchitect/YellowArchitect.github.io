	<h1>Oh, you want to know more about me?</h1> <! ;) >
	<p>I'm Benjamin Schmidt, a Junior in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I mostly made this site so that I wouldn't forget how to do basic web design stuff, so here it is.</p>
	<p>Some projects I'm working on is a couple game ideas with some friends and a API used to make random DND characters.</p>
	<p>At some point in the future I might do some research on machine learning and 3D space analysis.</p>
