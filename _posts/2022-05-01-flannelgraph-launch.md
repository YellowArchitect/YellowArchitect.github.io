Howdy guys, welcome back!

Last month I spent a good amount of my time setting up the official site for Flannelgraph, <a href="https://flannelgraph.net/">flannelgraph.net</a>, my new professional game developement business! I've been working on a fighting game for a couple months now, and I'll be using Flannelgraph as an alias for that and future works.

So what does this mean for this site? Posts I make at Flannelgraph will always have something to do with either gamedevelopment or Flannelgraph itself. Posts I make here will be related to anything I do outside of that scope. This does mean that there will probably be less posts here, but I'll try not to neglect this site and keep it fairly up to date.

Anyways, I hope you check out the <a href="https://flannelgraph.net/">new site</a>, but feel free to stop by here once in a while too. Cheers!
