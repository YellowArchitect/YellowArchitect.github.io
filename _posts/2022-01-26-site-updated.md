This is the first real update I've made since the site went up, so let me start off by saying hi! OK, now I should address some things.

First of all I intend to make updates here more regularly. I'm not sure how much more regularly, but I plan to make at least a couple more updates in the near future, including details on the capstone project I did at VT.

Secondly, I hope to actually showcase some of the things I've done here. I'm not sure how to link the projects I've submitted at itch.io here, but for know trust me when I say I'm working on it.

Finally, the DND API is no more for two reasons. One, I had essentially no work for it done. Two, as much as I enjoy the occasional game of DND, it also annoys me to no end and I simply don't have the patience or heart to work on the project anymore.

I hope everyone who reads this is having a great day and I'll keep you guys posted. Cheers!
